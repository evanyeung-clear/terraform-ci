            ### ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for opening a pull request!
            If this is your first pull request here (or itâ€™s been a while), please take a second to read how we [deploy changes]() to Okta â€” itâ€™s a little different than what you might be used to. A trimmed down summary is listed below:

            1. **Open a pull request** (you are here)
            Push your branch and open a PR as usual. This will trigger a terraform plan to show what would change.

            2. **Review and Approve**
            Wait for a team member to review and approve the PR. Automated pre-checks should also pass.

            3. **Deploy changes**
            Deploy changes live with  \`/terraform apply\` as a comment on this PR. 
                > If anything goes wrong, rollback with \`/deploy main\`

            4. **Merge after successful apply**
            Once terraform apply succeeds and the status check passes, you can merge the PR to main.
